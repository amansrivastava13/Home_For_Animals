A complete end-to-end project "Home_For_Animals". 
In this project we provided a list of abandoned pets along with their basic details to the people so that if they want they can adopt them from animal shelter.

Why we need to adopt ?
1. If you adopt, you'll save a life
2. Adopting will save you money (Adopting a pet is much less expensive than buying a pet)
3. If you adopt, you won't be supporting puppy mills and pet stores
4. Adopting a pet will make you feel better

Tech Stack Used:
Python, Django, SQL, Bootstrap
